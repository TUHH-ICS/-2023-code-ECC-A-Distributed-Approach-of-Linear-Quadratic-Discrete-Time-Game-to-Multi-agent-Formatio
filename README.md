## General
This repository contains an implementation of the algorithms and simulations described in 
> Prima Aditya and Herbert Werner, "A Distributed Linear Quadratic Discrete-Time Game Approach to Multi-Agent Formation with Collision Avoidance" submitted for ECC 2023

## Simulation
The main code `ecc2023.m` contains everything in one file with additional functions:
- `sig.m` to compute the norm approximation
- `zoom_plot.m` for zooming window 

This distributed framework based on iterative-scheme of steepest descent method. In this case, we took three vertices and two edges as an example. 

## Prerequisites
The simulation code in this repository was tested in the following environment:
- *Windows 11* Pro Version 21H2
- *Matlab* 2020a
